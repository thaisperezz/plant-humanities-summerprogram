### Talking about tea blah blah blah!

	   
I wonder what we are going to be doing next! This is so so fun I am just writing words to create a paragraph. That's very funny is it not, I wonder what's going to happen next. This is so funny because I am just writing random words ha. ha. ha. Good luck next time, I wonder why I chose to have a pink waterbottle. Coffee is great!

Ok so now we are going to do a comparative view of the *Camellia Sinensus*, which is super super important. Very Very exciting stuff, so I am doing a botanical illustration of the plant in Japanese, which is called *チャ、チャノキ*.  Thanks for that Thais.
