The nineteenth century, a century of battle and revolution, also marked tea as a commodity to expand colonial power. Countries discovered the economic validity of tea, and many decided to begin their own plantations to compete with other powers and increase their own wealth. The Portuguese were one of the primary countries to adopt the Camellia Sinensis, and did so by creating plantations in Portuguese colonies.

One of the colonies Portugal desired to utilize for tea plantations, was Brazil. Its land was fruitful and filled with laborers, which would allow for the smooth start of Portuguese plantations in South America. With the invasion of Franco-Spanish forces in 1808, the Portuguese royal family fled to Brazil with particular interest in science and botany. [^1] Portuguese curiosity in botany would spur interest in the development of tea plantations, and the beginning of negotiations with the Chinese government to facilitate the journey of tea plant seed over to Brazil.

The end of the Napoleonic wars almost collapsed the production of Portuguese tea in Brazil, with Dom John VI returning to Lisbon in 1821 to sooth political discord. [^2] Without a strong leader supporting the industry, efforts to maintain it failed, despite small successful pushes between 1820 and 1830. A destructive fungi, from the genus *Ceratobasidium* D.P.Rogers, which injures young plants, was the final nail in the coffin. Ultimately, it prevented the success of colonial tea plantations in Brazil for years to come.
