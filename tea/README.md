### Tea's Environmental Legacy

The nineteenth century, a century of battle and revolution, also marked tea as a commodity to expand colonial power. Countries discovered the economic validity of tea, and many decided to begin their own plantations to compete with other powers and increase their own wealth. The Portuguese were one of the primary countries to adopt the Camellia Sinensis, and did so by creating plantations in Portuguese colonies.

One of the colonies Portugal desired to utilize for tea plantations was Brazil. Its land was fruitful and filled with laborers, which would allow for the smooth start of Portuguese plantations in South America. With the invasion of Franco-Spanish forces in 1808, the Portuguese royal family fled to Brazil with particular interest in science and botany. [^1] Portuguese curiosity in botany would spur interest in the development of tea plantations, and the beginning of negotiations with the Chinese government to facilitate the journey of tea plant seed over to Brazil. Experimental plantations began in the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, with the aid of enslaved African and Chinese coolie laborers.

The end of the Napoleonic wars would soon collapse the production of Portuguese tea in Brazil, with Dom John VI returning to Lisbon in 1821 to sooth political discord. [^2] Without a strong leader supporting the industry, efforts to maintain it failed, despite very small successful pushes between 1820 and 1830. A destructive fungi, from the genus *Ceratobasidium* D.P.Rogers, which injures young plants, was the final nail in the coffin. Tea sprouts and young leaves were killed before they had the chance to flourish, which made it impossible to maintain the already tenuous plantations. Ultimately, this crisis prevented the success of colonial tea plantations in Brazil for years to come.

However, the story of the *Camellia Sinensis* in Brazil does not end with the nineteenth century. Even though many plantations from Brazil were abandoned in the 1800s, as a result of these plantations, the plant now exists in the Atlantic Forest, where it has begun outcompeting native species from the genera *Rubiaceae*, *Piperaceae*, and *Melastomataceae*, all crucial parts of the Brazilian ecosystem. While the tea plant has not yet been labeled as 'invasive,' studies have begun illustrating its potential for subduing native plants. [^3] The plant itself is creating a dangerous environment for endangered and native species which are already at risk. Tea has left a permanent imprint on Brazilian soil, and the creation of nineteenth century plantations left a lasting legacy on the environments that surrounded them.

Across the world, Georgia was prompted to acquire the *Camellia Sinensis*. In the 1830s, Prince Miha Eristavi traveled to China, returning to Georgia with smuggled tea seeds. Impressed by the taste of the plant, he harvested it himself, and used his seeds to begin the first tea plantations in Georgia. [^4] While these preliminary tea plantations were largely unsuccessful, with the help of Russia's imperial strength and plantation support, the 1860s saw massive growth in the Georgian tea industry.

Georgia became a tea-exporting powerhouse during the nineteenth century, and later became a central asset of the Soviet Union. The tea plantations created in the 1800s would set the stage for Georgian plantations today, which have complex relationships to the environments they exist in. These plantations face battles that are not uncommon in tea plantations globally; issues of sustainability and the welfare of the *Camellia Sinensis* are persistent.

The nineteenth century also jumpstarted a shift toward monoculture plantations which have negative effects on local flora and fauna. Land-use changes molded the Georgian environmental landscape to fit the monoculture model, making the ecosystem more vulnerable to disease, pests, and erosion. Despite the decline in tea production at the end of the twentieth century, tea plantations from nineteenth century Georgia have left a lasting legacy.

The present-day introduction of chemical and mineral inputs poses serious concerns to the Georgian tea industry. The use of pesticides and herbicides to combat the spread of weeds and pests is a threat to clean water sources, biodiversity, and human/animal health in Georgia. Fertilizer usage, especially mineral-based manuring, is a high environmental risk for the soil, water, and humans that surround the plantation. Outside of chemical inputs, irrigational damage on plantations in Georgia can bring high environmental hazards. The water source and the design of these systems can perpetuate the degradation of soil and unsustainable water usage.

With these issues in mind, many Georgian plantations have begun integrating more sustainable practices. A rush of plantations have begun organic farming, refusing to use chemical fertilizers and pesticides which present risks to the local ecosystems. Artisanal tea planting, where tea is produced in smaller batches on smaller pieces of land, is a recent trend to decrease Georgian reliance on massive monoculture farms. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the European Union have given aid to Georgian farmers, particularly smaller tea producers, to help transition them to use environmentally-conscious production practices and packaging. While these initiatives do not address all of the issues presented by plantations, producers and governmental agencies are more optimistic about the future of sustainably produced and managed Georgian tea plantations. These plantations will continue to grapple with questions of sustainability and attempt to integrate better alternatives to these pressing problems.

### Meaning as Mutable
The meaning of tea is variable, it shifts across time and space, changing with the people and cultures that live with it. The case studies from the nineteenth century give a snapshot of what tea meant to different people in different regions; the plant itself was a symbol for revolution, the impetus for a series of bloody wars, and a highly coveted economic product. The multiplicity of these definitions demonstrates that the tea plant cannot be viewed in isolation, but has to be placed within the context of the environments that exist around it.

Despite all of the separate transformations the plant has undergone, the Camellia Sinensis continues to exist ubiquitously in cultures globally. Historically, the plant changed the tides of wars and empires, and today it moves more subtly through daily routines and cultures. Today’s tea rituals continue to carry the weight of the nineteenth century, and despite this, the plant itself has remained resilient. Even through centuries of war and environmental destruction, the Camellia Sinensis lives on in plantations, gardens, labs, and even homes. While its meaning has changed over time, in different settings, the plant has remained a potent piece of human life and history. Every pot steeped and every kettle poured is more evidence of the enduring legacy of this influential plant. 

The Camellia Sinensis has evolved from its early beginnings in Europe as a luxury drink. ‘Tea’ today can refer to matcha, sweet tea, bubble tea, chai, or the various herbal teas that exist in kitchen cabinets nowadays. Many cultures use tea in foods like Chinese tea-smoked duck and the Japanese Ochazuke, where green tea is poured over rice, or even green tea ice cream from modern-day grocery stores. Perhaps it is the taste of this plant or its deep ties to culture that continuously draw human attention. Regardless of whether it is raspberry green tea or the crates of tea that launched the Boston Tea Party, the tea plant has remained the same. The only difference is the multilayered meanings now attached to it: culturally, economically, and politically.
