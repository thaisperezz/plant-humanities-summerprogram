The nineteenth century, a century of battle and revolution, also marked tea as a commodity to expand colonial power. Countries discovered the economic validity of tea, and many decided to begin their own plantations to compete with other powers and increase their own wealth. The Portuguese were one of the primary countries to adopt the Camellia Sinensis, and did so by creating plantations in Portuguese colonies.

One of the colonies Portugal desired to utilize for tea plantations was Brazil. Its land was fruitful and filled with laborers, which would allow for the smooth start of Portuguese plantations in South America. With the invasion of Franco-Spanish forces in 1808, the Portuguese royal family fled to Brazil with particular interest in science and botany. [^1] Portuguese curiosity in botany would spur interest in the development of tea plantations, and the beginning of negotiations with the Chinese government to facilitate the journey of tea plant seed over to Brazil.

The end of the Napoleonic wars almost collapsed the production of Portuguese tea in Brazil, with Dom John VI returning to Lisbon in 1821 to sooth political discord. [^2] Without a strong leader supporting the industry, efforts to maintain it failed, despite small successful pushes between 1820 and 1830. A destructive fungi, from the genus *Ceratobasidium* D.P.Rogers, which injures young plants, was the final nail in the coffin. Ultimately, it prevented the success of colonial tea plantations in Brazil for years to come.

However, the story of the *Camellia Sinensis* in Brazil does not end with the nineteenth century. Even though many plantations from Brazil were abandoned in the 1800s, the plant now exists in the Atlantic Forest, where it has begun outcompeting native species from the genera *Rubiaceae*, *Piperaceae*, and *Melastomataceae*, all crucial parts of the Brazilian ecosystem. While the tea plant has not yet been labeled as 'invasive,' studies have begun demonstrating its potential for subduing native plants. [^3] Tea has left a permanent imprint on Brazilian soil, and the creation of nineteenth century plantations left a lasting legacy on the environments that surrounded them.

Across the world, Georgia was prompted to acquire the *Camellia Sinensis*. In the 1830s, Prince Miha Eristavi traveled to China, returning to Georgia with smuggled tea seeds. Impressed by the taste of the plant, he harvested it himself, and used his seeds to begin the first tea plantations in Georgia. [^4] While these preliminary tea plantations were largely unsuccessful, with the help of Russia's imperial strength, the 1860s saw massive growth in the Georgian tea industry.

Georgia became a tea-exporting powerhouse during the nineteenth century, and later became a central asset of the Soviet Union. The tea plantations created in the 1800s would set the stage for Georgian plantations today, which have complex relationships to the environments they exist in.

Georgian tea plantations face battles that are not uncommon in tea plantations globally; issues of sustainability and welfare of the *Camellia Sinensis* are persistent.
